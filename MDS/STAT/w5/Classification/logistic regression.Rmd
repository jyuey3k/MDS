# Demonstration on using logisitic regression for two-class data classification

## Read in data
```{r}
# read in tab-delimited data file
breastCancerFull <- read.delim("breast-w.txt", head=TRUE);
```

## Split the data into training (80%) and test sets (20%)
```{r}
# Load the "caret" package. This package is used to partition data to training and test sets.
library(caret)
set.seed(1)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(breastCancerFull$Class, p = .8)[[1]]
breastCancerTrain <- breastCancerFull[ inTrain, ]
breastCancerTest  <- breastCancerFull[-inTrain, ]
```

## Build a logistic regression model using a single feature of "Cell_Size_Uniformity"
```{r}
# Here we create a logistic regression model using the train() function. For the "method" parameter, "glm" stands for "generalized linear model" and using "glm" correspond to calling the "glm" package. This call will produce a logistic regression model.
# The trControl parameter gives control of what methods to be used for evaluating and selecting model and how many times such procedure will be repeated. We will introduce model evaluation and selection in later lectures.
set.seed(1)
logisticReg1 <- train(Class ~ Cell_Size_Uniformity,
                     data = breastCancerTrain,
                     method = "glm",
                     trControl = trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", 
                                              repeats = 5))

## Print diagnostic and summary information and statistics fo the model 
logisticReg1
summary(logisticReg1)
```

## Build another logistic regression model using a single feature of "Clump_Thickness"
```{r}
set.seed(1)
logisticReg2 <- train(Class ~ Clump_Thickness,
                     data = breastCancerTrain,
                     method = "glm",
                     trControl = trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", 
                                              repeats = 5))
logisticReg2
summary(logisticReg2)
```


## Build a logistic regression model using all features
```{r}
# Notice that we used the training set of the data to training this and the above two logistic regression models.
set.seed(1)
logisticRegFull <- train(Class ~ .,
                     data = breastCancerTrain,
                     method = "glm",
                     trControl = trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", 
                                              repeats = 5))

logisticRegFull
summary(logisticRegFull)
# Using $ sign to extract the model selected by our "trControl" procedure and print its information
logisticRegFull$finalModel
```

## Prediction on the test set
```{r}
# Create prediction function that takes in a logistic regression model and extract some prediction information from this model on predicting test set and subsequently return these prediction information.
PredictFunc <- function(logisticReg) {
  breastCancerResults <- data.frame(obs = breastCancerTest$Class)
  breastCancerResults$prob <- predict(logisticReg, breastCancerTest, type = "prob")[, "malignant"]
  breastCancerResults$pred <- predict(logisticReg, breastCancerTest)
  breastCancerResults$Label <- ifelse(breastCancerResults$obs == "malignant", 
                              "True Outcome: malignant", 
                              "True Outcome: benign")
  return(breastCancerResults)
}

# Now use the three models that we created above to perform classification on the test set of the data. 
breastCancerResults1 <- PredictFunc(logisticReg1)
breastCancerResults2 <- PredictFunc(logisticReg2)
breastCancerResultsFull <- PredictFunc(logisticRegFull)
```

## Prediction results visualization
```{r probability of malignancy, fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=15}
# First, let us plot the probability of malignancy
library(gridExtra)
hist1 <- histogram(~prob|Label, data = breastCancerResults1, layout = c(2, 1), nint = 20, xlab = "Probability of malignancy",
          type = "count", main="LogisticReg1")
hist2 <- histogram(~prob|Label, data = breastCancerResults2, layout = c(2, 1), nint = 20, xlab = "Probability of malignancy",
          type = "count", main="LogisticReg2")
hist3 <- histogram(~prob|Label, data = breastCancerResultsFull, layout = c(2, 1), nint = 20, xlab = "Probability of malignancy",
          type = "count", main="LogisticRegFull")
grid.arrange(hist1, hist2, hist3, nrow=3)

# Now, create the confusion matrix from the test set.
confusionMatrix(data = breastCancerResults1$pred, 
                reference = breastCancerResults1$obs)
confusionMatrix(data = breastCancerResults2$pred, 
                reference = breastCancerResults2$obs)
confusionMatrix(data = breastCancerResultsFull$pred, 
                reference = breastCancerResultsFull$obs)
```

## Using "pROC" package to evaluate, compare and visualize performance of each model. 
```{r Fig2, fig.align='center',fig.width=5,fig.height=5}
# perform evaluation using pROC package
library(pROC)
breastCancerROC1 <- roc(breastCancerResults1$obs, breastCancerResults1$prob)
breastCancerROC2 <- roc(breastCancerResults2$obs, breastCancerResults2$prob)
breastCancerROCFull <- roc(breastCancerResultsFull$obs, breastCancerResultsFull$prob)

# calling some useful function to evaluate a model
auc(breastCancerROC1)
ci.auc(breastCancerROC1)

# visualize and compare performance using ROC curve. Note ROC curve stands for "receiver operating characteristic" curve
plot(breastCancerROC1, legacy.axes = TRUE, col="red")
plot(breastCancerROC2, legacy.axes = TRUE, col="blue", add=TRUE)
plot(breastCancerROCFull, legacy.axes = TRUE, col="black", add=TRUE)

# output session information
sessionInfo()
