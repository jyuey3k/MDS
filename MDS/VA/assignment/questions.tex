\subsubsection{Preparation}
Visualisation was created using yed, for which the provided graphml was imported. It is noted that editing of the source was done via vim to ensure correct importation of edges via addition of 
\begin{verbatim}
for = ``edges''
\end{verbatim}
in the relation and type sections of the provided graph information. As the visualisation at the current moment is poor, different layouts were tried (organic, hierachy etc) for which a radial setting with wide node dispersal was observed to be the best fit. This is due to the clarity in node positioning with minimial edge crossings whilst preserving this node clarity. Then the status of the characters (either dead or alive) were differentiated through selecting nodes possessin these qualities, and assigning a node shape for clarity (diamond = dead), (circle = alive). Then using the yed property mapper, all the above line, colour assignments were done. Then reflecting the amount of directed incoming edges on nodes, the nodes were resized to show weights.

\subsubsection{Strengths and Weakness}
There are some key strengths in the above visualisation, with the relationships between each individual explicitly showna and the node placements highlighting key members (Danerys, Jon Snow). Despite this the visualisation possess multiple edge crossings which is not desired. This was attempted to be mitigated through different edge colourings between differing relationship types, however it should still be considered. To make these clearer the subgraphs shown above (page 3 and 4) show clearly the familial and love ties and the allegiance as an attempt to further elucidate these relationships
\subsection{Familial and Love Ties}
\subsubsection{Legend} 
Same as Main visualization
\subsubsection{Preparation}
Using the yed object selection tool, and searching up erroneous relation types such as; allegiance and killed we can generate the familial and love ties between characters. A directed tree highlighted this relationships very clearly. 
\subsubsection{Strengths and Weaknesses}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Very Clear familial and love ties shown
	\item excluded some characters who did not possess these ties, and did not show allegiances
	\item Generated Four Seperate Trees
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Allegiance}
\subsubsection{Legend}
Same as Main
\subsubsection{Preparation}
Using the object selection tool off the main graph and searching up erroneous relation typs such as father mother sibling killed spouse lover, a visualization of the flow of allegiance can be generated. 
\subsubsection{Strengths and Weaknesses}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Very Clear allgegiances shown
	\item excluded some characters who did not have allegiances 
	\item missing familial data 
	\item Generated many small trees 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Graph Drawing Contest 1999 B Visualisation}
\subsection{Organic Layou}
\subsubsection{Preparation}
The graph was constructed using yed. Multiple layouts were attempted in the beginning of the processas the importation yielded a very cluttered very messy layout comprised of multiple edge crossings.  After multiple trial and error patterns, an organic layout was selected. This was not particularly good as the spacing of the nodes were very poor and multiple edge crossing were evident. Furthermore there was no clear indication of two nodes with a self directed edge. After some parameter adjustments such as enabling the options of avoiding edge node overlap and compactness arguments under an aspect ratio restriction, the above visualization was produced after node enlargement and coloring  which clearly highlights the nodes with self directed edges 15259 and 15241.

\subsubsection{Strengths and Weaknessess}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Very Clear edges and layout with compact drawin
	\item Could possibly generate a more regularized graph shape with lesser edge crossings (which seemed impossible with yed) 
	\item  Does not show a clear network flow and has upward pointing arrows with no layering
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Hierachical Directed Graph}
\subsubsection{Preparation}
We provide an alternative visulaisation as according to the parameters in the lecture slides. This was done via hiearchical layout generation with specificed layering. 
\subsubsection{Strengths and Weaknessess}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Directed Graph format as in the lectures with downwards pointing arrows and clear layering shown 
	\item Confusing non-compact layout with multiple crossings that are suboptimal
\end{enumerate}
